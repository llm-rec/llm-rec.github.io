          Our workshop addresses the relation between Recommender Systems (RS) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Although LLMs have shown impressive performance in various tasks, numerous unresolved challenges remain regarding their practical effectiveness and applicability in recommendation scenarios. Conversely, exploring how recommendation systems can in turn accelerate the development and deployment of LLMs is also a compelling direction, attracting growing interest from researchers and practitioners.

        <h3 class="col-12">Workshop Tracks</h3>
        <p class="large text-muted">
          Specifically, this workshop will center around two complementary directions: 
          <em><strong>LLM4Rec</strong></em> and <em><strong>Rec4LLM</strong></em>. The LLM4Rec track emphasizes enhancing recommendation performance using LLMs, while the Rec4LLM track focuses on utilizing recommendation techniques and rich user-item interaction data to support and advance the development of LLM applications.
        </p>

        <h3 class="col-12">Topics of Interest</h3>
        <ul class="large text-muted">
          <li>Do recommendation systems benefit from reasoning capabilities? How can LLMs' reasoning skills enhance recommendation quality?</li>
          <li>How can generative models improve existing recommendation algorithms or facilitate AI-generated content (AIGC)?</li>
          <li>How can LLMs inspire novel recommendation paradigms (e.g., interactive/explainable recommendations)?</li>
          <li>How can scaling-up methods from LLMs be applied to recommender systems?</li>
          <li>How can recommendation techniques facilitate selection of memories, tools, and agents?</li>
          <li>Enhancing foundation models with recommendation scenario data for human knowledge integration</li>
        </ul>
