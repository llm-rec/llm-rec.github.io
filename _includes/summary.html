                Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities that present both
                transformative opportunities and significant challenges for recommender systems. Our workshop explores
                the bidirectional synergy between LLMs and recommender systems through two complementary directions:
                LLM4Rec, which focuses on leveraging LLMs' reasoning, semantic understanding, and generative
                capabilities to enhance recommendation quality and user experience; and Rec4LLM, which investigates how
                recommendation techniques and rich user-item interaction data can advance LLM development and
                deployment. We bring together leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to
                address critical challenges including cold-start scenarios, explainability, interactive paradigms, and
                scaling laws, while exploring novel applications such as reasoning-enhanced recommendations,
                AI-generated content, and LLM agent coordination. Through keynote presentations, interactive panels, and
                collaborative discussions, our workshop aims to establish unified understanding and identify promising
                research directions at this rapidly evolving intersection, ultimately shaping the future of
                next-generation recommender systems in the LLM era. </p>
