## Call for Papers

Our workshop addresses the relation between Recommender Systems (RS) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Although LLMs have shown impressive performance in various tasks, numerous unresolved challenges remain regarding their practical effectiveness and applicability in recommendation scenarios. Conversely, exploring how recommendation systems can in turn accelerate the development and deployment of LLMs is also a compelling direction, attracting growing interest from researchers and practitioners. Specifically, this workshop will center around two complementary directions: **LLM4Rec** and **Rec4LLM**. The LLM4Rec track emphasizes enhancing recommendation performance using LLMs, while the Rec4LLM track focuses on utilizing recommendation techniques and rich user-item interaction data to support and advance the development of LLM applications.

We welcome original contributions studying LLM4Rec and Rec4LLM, including (but not limited to) the following topics:
+ Do recommendation systems benefit from reasoning capabilities, and if so, how can LLMs' reasoning skills be leveraged to enhance recommendation quality?
+ How can generative models improve existing recommendation algorithms or facilitate AI-generated content (AIGC) within recommendation applications?
+ How can the semantic understanding capability of LLMs inspire novel recommendation paradigms, such as interactive and explainable recommendations?
+ How can we explore scaling-up methods in recommender systems, analogous to those successfully applied in LLMs, to significantly enhance recommendation performance?
+ How can recommendation techniques efficiently and adaptively facilitate the selection of memories, tools, and agents for diverse scenarios and tasks?
+ How to enhance foundation models that integrate VLA data from recommendation scenarios to incorporate more generalizable and valuable human knowledge?

**Submission Guidelines**
+ Paper length: 4-8 pages (excluding references and appendices)
+ Format: Use the [NeurIPS](https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2025/Styles.zip) LaTeX template
+ Anonymization: Submissions should be anonymized for double-blind review
+ Dual-submission policy (non-archival): Accepted papers will not be archived, welcoming ongoing and unpublished work and allowing for future submission to other conferences. We welcome submissions that are currently under review at other venues. However, we cannot consider work that has been previously published or accepted for publication at any venue. This policy on dual submissions remains in effect throughout the entire reviewing process.


## Important Dates (Tentative)
All deadlines are 23:59 AoE  
+ Submission deadline: **August 22**, 2025
+ Author notification: **September 22**, 2025
+ Camera ready deadline: TBD
+ Workshop date: **December 6 or 7**, 2025
